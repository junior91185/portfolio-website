        <h1>Broadcasting & DoS Mitigation</h1>
        <p>This project was developed as part of a hands-on lab for <i>Introduction to Cryptography and Computer Security</i>. It demonstrates:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Client-server communication using UDP.</li>
            <li>Broadcasting messages from the client to the server.</li>
            <li>Implementation of DoS (Denial of Service) mitigation strategies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>This lab provided an opportunity to apply networking principles in a practical setting, showcasing skills in socket programming, multithreading, and DoS mitigation techniques.</p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Client-Server Communication:</strong> Clients broadcast UDP messages to the server, and the server listens and responds dynamically.</li>
            <li><strong>Anti-DoS Strategies:</strong> Implementing rate-limiting requests per client and blacklisting abusive clients.</li>
            <li><strong>Multithreading:</strong> The server uses multithreaded request handling for better scalability.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Example Usage</h2>
        <p>Set up the Server to listen for Client broadcast</p>
        <pre><code>server_RecieveBroadcast.py

import socket

# Server setup
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
server_socket.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_BROADCAST, 1)    #this socket designed to accept broadcasting
server_socket.bind(("", 5005))                      # Bind to all interfaces on server port 5005 (hypothetical port)

print("Server is listening for broadcasts...")

....... </code>
        </pre>

        <img src="images/server_listening.png" alt="Server Listening" class="project-image">

        <p>Set up the Client to broadcasts messages</p>
        <pre><code>client_broadcastingServert.py

import socket

# Client setup
client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM) 
client_socket.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_BROADCAST, 1) 
client_socket.settimeout(2)

message = b"Broadcasting message to server"
client_socket.sendto(message, ('<broadcast>', 5005))  # Send broadcast for all devices listening to port 5005

try:
# Receive response from server
    data, addr = client_socket.recvfrom(1024)
    print(f"Received response: {data.decode()} from {addr}")
except socket.timeout:
    print("No response received.")
        </code></pre>

        

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The Server listens for broadcasts and responds to the Client:</p>
        <pre><code>server_RecieveBroadcast.py 

.......

while True:
# Receive message from client
data, addr = server_socket.recvfrom(1024)    ##buffer size 1024
print(f"Received message: {data.decode()} from {addr}")
        
# Respond to client
server_socket.sendto(b"Hello from server!", addr)   # server will share her IP address with the client
        </code></pre>

        <h2>Denial-of-Service (DoS) Mitigation in Action</h2>
        <p>The server safeguards itself against excessive traffic by implementing rate limiting and blacklisting abusive clients.</p>
        
        <p>By using <strong>client_broadcasting_loop.py</strong>, I was able to simulate a Client overwhelming a Server with requests, mimicking the behavior of a "real" Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. The client program continuously broadcasts messages to the server at a rapid rate, demonstrating how an attacker might try to flood a server with excessive traffic to disrupt its normal operations.</p> <p>To counter this simulated attack, I developed <strong>anti_DoS_server_Advanced.py</strong>, a server-side script designed to detect and mitigate the impact of such attacks. This program implements a rate-limiting mechanism that monitors the number of requests received from each client. If a client exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 15 requests per second), the server temporarily blacklists the client by blocking its requests for a specific duration. Additionally, the server tracks "repeat offenders"—clients who exceed the rate limit multiple times—and permanently blocks them if they are blacklisted three times.</p> </p>
